# Basic usage

JacoDB API has two levels:
* the one provides you with information represented in filesystem, i.e., with `bytecode` and `classes`;
* the other one provides you with information appearing at runtime, i.e., with `types`.

`bytecode` and `classes` represent data from `.class` files: class with methods, fields, etc.<br></br>
`types` represent types that can be nullable, parameterized, etc.

    <summary><code>Types</code> diagram</summary>
    <img src={require('/src/assets/types-diagram.svg')} alt={'Types diagram'}/>
</details>

Both levels are connected to `JcClasspath`. You can't modify classes retrieved from pure bytecode.
`types` may be constructed manually by generic substitution.

`JcClasspath` is an entry point for both classes and types.

`JcClassOrInterface` represents a class file. An array or a primitive gets no `JcClassOrInterface`.

`JcType` represents a type from JVM runtime.

`JcClassType#methods` contains:

* all the public/protected/private methods of an enclosing class
* all the ancestor methods visible at compile time
* only constructor methods from the declaring class

`JcClassType#fields` contains:

* all the public/protected/private fields of an enclosing class
* all the ancestor fields visible at compile time

## Get declared methods

<JavaKotlinCodeBlock
    javaCode={Examples.getDeclaredMethods.java}
    kotlinCode={Examples.getDeclaredMethods.kotlin}
/>

Note: the `body` method returns `null` if the to-be-processed JAR-file is changed or removed. If the class
environment is incomplete (i.e., a superclass, an interface, a return type or a parameter of a method is not found
in classpath), then the API throws `NoClassInClasspathException` at runtime.

## Watch for file system changes

The database can watch for file system changes in the background and refresh the JAR-files explicitly:

<JavaKotlinCodeBlock
    javaCode={Examples.watchFileSystem.java}
    kotlinCode={Examples.watchFileSystem.kotlin}
/>

## Get type information

The represented `types` include
* primitives,
* classes,
* arrays,
* bounded and unbounded wildcards.

The `types` level represents runtime behavior according to parameter substitution in the given generic type.

<JavaKotlinCodeBlock
    javaCode={Examples.getTypeInformation.java}
    kotlinCode={Examples.getTypeInformation.kotlin}
/>

## Multithreading

The instances of `JcClassOrInterface`, `JcMethod`, and `JcClasspath` are thread-safe and immutable.

`JcClasspath` represents an independent snapshot of classes, which cannot be modified since it is created.
Removing or modifying library files does not affect `JcClasspath` instance structure. The `JcClasspath#close` method releases
all snapshots and cleans up the persisted data if some libraries are outdated.

<JavaKotlinCodeBlock
    javaCode={Examples.refreshDatabase.java}
    kotlinCode={Examples.refreshDatabase.kotlin}
/>

If a request for a `JcClasspath` instance contains the libraries, which haven't been indexed yet,
the indexing process is triggered and the new instance of the `JcClasspath` set is returned.

<JavaKotlinCodeBlock
    javaCode={Examples.autoProcessing.java}
    kotlinCode={Examples.autoProcessing.kotlin}
/>

`JacoDB` is thread-safe. If one requests `JcClasspath` instance while loading JAR-files from another thread,
`JcClasspath` can represent only a consistent state of the JAR-files being loaded. It is the completely loaded
JAR-file that appears in `JcClasspath`. Please note: it is not guaranteed that all the JAR-files, submitted for loading,
will be actually loaded.

<JavaKotlinCodeBlock
    javaCode={Examples.newThread.java}
    kotlinCode={Examples.newThread.kotlin}
/>

## Bytecode loading

Bytecode loading consists of two steps:

* retrieving information about the class names from the JAR-files or build directories,
* reading `classes` bytecode from the JAR-files or build directories and processing it (persisting data, setting
up `JcFeature` implementations, etc.).

`JacoDB` or `JcClasspath` instances are returned right after the first step is performed. You retrieve the final representation
of `classes` during the second step. The `.class` files may undergo changes at some moment between
these two steps, and the `classes` representation is affected accordingly.
