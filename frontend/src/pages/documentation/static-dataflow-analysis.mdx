# Static dataflow analysis

With the `jacodb-analysis` module, one can perform static dataflow analysis based on the three-address code intermediate representation.
It implements the IFDS solver, described in the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/199448.199462">Reps, Horwitz, and Sagiv (1995)</a> paper.
IFDS is the acronym for the class of the _interprocedural_, _finite_, _distributive_, _subset_ problems.

The `jacodb-analysis` module provides you with several ready-to-use analyses along with an API to build your own analyses.

Current implementation splits code into `Units`, so that the IFDS framework can analyse them concurrently.
Information is shared between the units via `Summaries`, but the lifecycle of each unit is controlled
separately. This makes the implementation highly scalable and still precise.

## Basic usage

You can perform analysis right from your code or via command-line interface.

### Calling from your code

The analysis entry point is the `runAnalysis` method declared in `AnalysisMain`.
It takes the following parameters:
* `graph` — an application graph that is used for analysis, the _supergraph_ in terms of the <a href="https://dx.doi.
org/10.1145/199448.199462">original paper</a>.
To obtain this graph, one should call the `newApplicationGraphForAnalysis` method from `ApplicationGraphFactory`.
* `unitResolver` — an object that groups methods into units. Find more about <a href="#unit-resolvers">unit resolvers</a>.
* `ifdsUnitRunner` — a runner instance, which is used to analyze each unit. This is what defines concrete analysis.
Ready-to-use runners are located in `RunnersLibrary`.
* `methods` — a list of methods to analyze.
* `timeoutMillis` — an optional timeout (in milliseconds).

For example, to detect the unused variables in the given `analyzedClass` methods, you may run the following code
(assuming that `classpath` is an instance of `JcClasspath`):

<JavaKotlinCodeBlock
    javaCode={Examples.runAnalysisExample.java}
    kotlinCode={Examples.runAnalysisExample.kotlin}
/>

### Using command-line interface

To perform analyses, one can use command-line interface (CLI) from the `jacodb-cli` module.
Specify the following arguments:
* `--analysisConf, -a` — a path to a file with the analyses configuration in the JSON format (find detailed
description below).
* `--start, -s` — classes to start the analyses from.
* `--classpath, -cp` — a classpath necessary for JacoDB analyses.
* `[optional] --dbLocation, -l` — location of SQLite database to store bytecode data.
If not specified, no data will be stored in the database.
* `[optional] --output, -o` — a file to store the analysis report. It defaults to `report.json`.

The analyses configuration file should declare an `analyses` object, where each key is a name of analysis,
and each value is an object with the custom settings.
For a specified analysis, `runAnalysis` is executed once.
By now, the only thing you can specify in settings is the unit resolver. It defaults to `MethodUnitResolver`.

An example of a configuration file:
```
{
  "analyses": {
    "NPE": {},
    "Unused": {
      "UnitResolver": "class"
    },
    "SQL": {}
  }
}
```
## Unit resolvers

`UnitResolver` is a simple interface with a `resolve` function mapping `JcMethod` to a custom `UnitType` domain.
It splits all methods into groups, or _units_, that can be analyzed concurrently.
In general, larger units mean more precise but also more resource-consuming analysis, so `UnitResolver` allows you
to reach compromise.
You can create your own `UnitResolver`, but usually you can use the predefined one from the `UnitResolversLibrary`
class,
e.g., `methodUnitResolver` and `singletonUnitResolver`. Below is the list of predefined resolvers:
* `methodUnitResolver` — each unit contains exactly one method. This resolver gives you the fastest
but also the least precise analysis. Use it if you analyze a large amount of code,
like big projects or libraries.
* `classUnitResolver` — each unit corresponds to a class: all methods from one class belong to one unit.
* `packageUnitResolver` — same as previous, but each unit corresponds to a package it is declared in.
* `singletonUnitResolver` — all existing methods belong to the same unit. Using this resolver gives you the most precise
but also the most resource-consuming analysis. Use it when you analyze a small amount of code, like
one class or a small project.

## Application graph

Source code information is provided through a `JcApplicationGraph` instance during analysis.
This interface combines a control-flow graph (CFG) with a call graph of a program, thus providing a so-called
_supergraph_.
The easiest way to create the instance is to call `newApplicationGraphForAnalysis` from `ApplicationGraphFactory`.

It has a `bannedPackagePrefixes` parameter, which is a list of strings.
If some method is declared in a package, which name starts with one of these strings, this method is not included
in the application graph, and therefore is not analyzed.
If `null` is passed, then the `defaultBannedPackagePrefixes` value is used, which prevents most of
the Java and Kotlin standard library methods from being analyzed.
Below is the code that allows to additionally ban a custom package
(assuming we already have a `classpath` as an instantiation of `JcClasspath`):

<JavaKotlinCodeBlock
    javaCode={Examples.customApplicationGraph.java}
    kotlinCode={Examples.customApplicationGraph.kotlin}
/>

## `Runners` library

Below is the list of implemented runners located in `RunnersLibrary`:

* `NpeRunner` — finds places where `NullPointerException` may occur.
* `UnusedVariableRunner` — finds all statements where unused variables are declared.
* `TaintRunner` — a runner that provides generic taint analysis. To build it, you need to provide
`sourceMethods` (i.e., methods that produce taints),
`sinkMethods` (i.e., methods that should not take tainted value as a parameter or receiver)
and `sanitizeMethods` (i.e., methods that transform a tainted value into the untainted one).
If there is a trace between the source and the sink (without passing sanitizing methods),
it is reported as a vulnerability.
* `SqlInjectionRunner` — performs concrete taint analysis that finds places where an SQL injection is possible.

## Writing custom runners

Specifying your own analysis is harder than using the predefined ones.
To do it, you should be familiar with dataflow analysis, IFDS framework, and flow functions.

### One-pass runner

To implement a simple one-pass analyzer, use `IfdsBaseUnitRunner`.
To instantiate it, you need an `AnalyzerFactory` instance, which is an object that can create `Analyzer` via
`JcApplicationGraph`.
The `Analyzer` interface contains the following methods that have to be implemented
(please note that this interface is **EXPERIMENTAL** and **LIKELY TO BE CHANGED SOON**):
* `getFlowFunctions()` — should return a `FlowFunctionsSpace` object, describing the four kinds of flow functions,
as defined in the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/199448.199462">original paper</a>
* `List<SummaryFact> getSummaryFacts(IfdsEdge edge)` — this method is called by `IfdsBaseUnitRunner` each time
a new path edge is found. The method should return all `SummaryFact` elements that are produced by this edge.
If some vulnerability is detected, it should be returned as `VulnerabilityLocation`. When the analysis finishes,
a `TraceGraph` for this location is resolved, and `VulnerabilityInstance` is added to results. This is the preferred
method to return summary facts.
* `List<SummaryFact> getSummaryFacts(IfdsResults ifdsResults)` — same as above, but this method is called only once
by `IfdsBaseUnitRunner` when the propagation of facts is finished (normally or due to cancellation). It should not
return facts that have been already returned by the previous method.
* `getSaveSummaryEdgesAndCrossUnitCalls()` — when `true`, summary edges and `CrossUnitCalleeFact` elements are automatically
added to the summary. This is needed for forward analyses to improve precision and restore traces, but this can
usually be set to `false` for backward analyses.

### Composite runners

For higher precision, bidirectional analysis is usually performed.
To implement this, you can create backward and forward runners as described above
and join them using one of the existing composite runners:

* `SequentialBidiIfdsUnitRunner` — takes two runners, the `forward` and `backward` ones, and runs them sequentially:
first it runs
`backward` analysis on a reversed graph, then it runs `forward` analysis on a normal graph.
* `ParallelBidiIfdsUnitRunner` — same as previous, but it launches both runners concurrently.
