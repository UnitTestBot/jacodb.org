# Raw instruction list API

`JcRawInstList` represents a raw list representation of three-address Java bytecode instructions. "Raw" means that
this representation does not depict information about
types and control flow of the program. This representation is one-to-one
matching of JVM bytecode instructions to the list of three-address instructions.

The base class of this representation is `JcRawInstList`. It produces a list-like
collection of instructions, so you can modify this list, iterate over instructions or access them by
index.

## Three-address instructions

`JcRawInst` is the base interface for the raw instructions. All instructions are identified
by the object, they are not comparable using `equals`.

Here is the list of `JcRawInst` implementations:

* `JcAssignInst` &mdash; Assignment instruction. Left-hand side of the instruction can only be `JcRawValue`,
right-hand side can be any expression (`JcRawExpr`).
* `JcRawEnterMonitorInst`, `JcRawExitMonitorInst` &mdash; Monitor instructions. Correspond
directly to their existing analogs. The `monitor` property can only be `JcRawSimpleValue`.
* `JcRawCallInst` &mdash; Call instruction. Represents a method that does not save its return
variable to any local variable. Method calls that return a value are represented via `JcRawAssignInst`.
* `JcRawLabelInst` &mdash; Label instruction. Used to mark some program points in the code. Mainly required
to be used in the branching instructions. A label is identified by name, all the references
to a label are represented via `JcRawLabelRef` class.
* `JcRawReturnInst` &mdash; Return instruction. The `returnValue` property is `null` when a method does not
return anything.
* `JcRawThrowInst` &mdash; Throw instruction.
* `JcRawCatchInst` &mdash; Catch instruction. Represents an entry for a `try...catch` block in the
code. Does not map directly to a bytecode instruction but represents a `TryCatchBlock` of a method.
Stores a value that corresponds to a caught `throwable` exception and a range of the instructions
that it catches from `startInclusive until endExclusive`.
* `JcRawGotoInst` &mdash; Jump instruction.
* `JcRawIfInst` &mdash; Conditional jump instruction. The condition of the instruction should
necessarily be `JcRawConditionExpr` because not all the conditional expressions that we use
in higher-level programming languages can be easily expressed in JVM bytecode.
* `JcRawSwitchInst` &mdash; Switch instruction. A combined representation of `LookupSwitch` and `TableSwitch`
bytecode instructions.

## Raw expressions

`JcRawExpr` is a base interface for all the expression types and value types that can be
expressed in JVM bytecode. `JcRawExpr` stores its type as a `TypeName` object which is just a Java type name
represented as a string (that's why it is "raw").

Here is the list of `JcRawExpr` implementations:

* `JcRawBinaryExpr` &mdash; Binary expression that allows to implement all the arithmetic
expressions (e.g. `JcRawAdd`, `JcRawMul`, etc.), conditional expressions (`JcRawEq`, `JcRawGt`, etc.),
logical expressions (`JcRawAnd`, `JcRawOr`, `JcRawXor`).
* `JcRawConditionExpr` &mdash; Conditional expressions. Can be used as a condition in `JcRawIfInst`.
* `JcRawLengthExpr` &mdash; Array length expression.
* `JcRawNegExpr` &mdash; Negation expression.
* `JcRawCastExpr` &mdash; Cast expression. Can be used to cast both reference types and primitive types.
* `JcRawNewExpr` &mdash; New expression. Creates a single object.
* `JcRawNewArrayExpr` &mdash; New array expression. Creates a (multi)array of a given type.
* `JcRawInstanceOfExpr` &mdash; `Instanceof` check.
* `JcRawCallExpr` &mdash; Method call expression.
* `JcRawDynamicCallExpr` &mdash; An `invokedynamic` instruction representation. Preserves all the info.
* `JcRawVirtualCallExpr`
* `JcRawInterfaceCallExpr`
* `JcRawStaticCallExpr`
* `JcRawSpecialCallExpr`
* `JcRawValue` &mdash; Representation of a single value.
* `JcRawSimpleValue` &mdash; Representation of a simple value that does not have any sub-values.
* `JcRawThis`
* `JcRawArgument`
* `JcRawLocal`
* `JcRawConstant`
* `JcRawComplexValue` &mdash; Complex value that has subvalues.
* `JcRawFieldRef` &mdash; Field reference. Can be used both as a field read access (e.g. `a = x.y`)
and field store access (e.g. `x.y = a`).
* `JcRawArrayAccess` &mdash; Array element reference. Can be used both as an array read access (e.g. `a = x[y]`)
and array store access (e.g. `x[y] = a`)

To get a three-address instruction list representation of a method you need to call `JcMethod::instructionList`.
Instruction list building requires `JcClasspath` because some stages use subtyping information.

## Constructing the instruction list: implementation details

`RawInstListBuilder` is used to build a `JcRawInstList` from bytecode representation (i.e. from `MethodNode`).
To build an instruction list representation, `MethodNode` **should** contain frame information (i.e. the `FrameNode`
instances) and **should not** contain `JSR` (jump subroutine) instructions. Thus, each time a `ClassNode` is
created, we invoke `ClassNode.computeFrames()` extension function that computes frame information
for each method. The `computeFrames` function uses ASM functionality for computing frames: it converts
the `ClassNode` back to bytecode using `ClassWriter` (which actually performs frame computing during
the conversion) and reads that bytecode again using `ClassReader`. This is not the most effective way of
doing things, but the easiest one: manually computing frames is quite hard.
Another thing is inlining `JSR` instructions. We do this by calling `MethodNode.jsrInlined` extension that
returns a new `MethodNode` instance. It uses ASM `JSRInlinerAdapter` utility to create a new method node with
inlined JRS instructions.

`RawInstListBuilder` converts JVM bytecode instruction list into a three-address instruction list. Most of
the conversion process is simple: bytecode instructions map to three-address expressions and instructions.
The most complex part is frame merging. JVM frame describes the state of the virtual machine at each instruction, i.e.
the declared local variables and stack state. When an instruction has multiple predecessors, we need to merge several
incoming frames into one. Sometimes JVM adds a special frame node before an instruction to describe how the
frame should look like after merging.

Four situations are possible during the frame merging process.

(1) There is only one incoming frame, and it is fully defined (i.e. we have already collected all the frame information)
when converting the previous stages. In that case, everything is quite simple, and we can just copy the frame info.
However, we can also refine type information for local variables. Consider following bytecode:

```
NEW java/lang/ArrayList
ASTORE 0
...
FRAME FULL [ java/lang/List ]
...
NEW java/lang/LinkedList
ASTORE 0
```

When converting the first two instructions, we created a local variable `%0` for _cell 0_ with `java.lang.ArrayList` type.
However, when converting frame information, we see that JVM considers the type of _cell 0_ to be `java.lang.List`
and then uses _cell 0_ to store other implementations of Java `List`. We can refine the type of `%0` to be
`java.lang.List` and then replace all the occurrences of `%0` with the new version. That is performed by
using `localTypeRefinement` property of `RawInstListBuilder` and `ExprMapper` utility class.

(2) There is only one incoming frame, and it has not been defined yet. It is a rare case, but it can happen in
a situation like this:

```
GOTO L2
L1
FRAME FULL [ java/lang/List ]
...
GOTO L3
L2
...
GOTO L1
L3
RETURN
```

In this situation, we use frame info to create a new local variable with the defined type and remember to
add an assignment that will initialize a new variable with a correct value in the predecessor. It is performed in the
end by using `laterAssignments` and `laterStackAssignments` maps as well as the `buildRequiredAssignments` function.
The process is similar for both stack variables and local variables.

(3) There are several predecessor frames, and all of them are defined (e.g. when merging after `if...else` block). In
that case, we create a new local variable with the defined type in the current frame and add necessary assignments
into the predecessor blocks.

(4) There are several predecessor frames, and not all of them are defined (e.g. when merging in the loop header).In
that case, we create a new local variable with the defined type in the current frame, add necessary assignments
into the predecessor blocks, and remember to add the required assignments to undefined predecessor blocks
in the end.

`RawInstListBuilder` also simplifies the resulting instruction list. It is necessary because the list constructing
process naturally introduces a lot of redundancy.

The main simplification stages are:
1. Deleting the repeated assignments inside a basic block.
2. Deleting declarations of unused variables.
3. Deleting declarations of mutually dependent unused variables (e.g. `a = b` and `b = a`).
4. Simple unit propagation.
5. Type normalization using `JcClasspath`.

## Visitor API

There is a _visitor_ API for traversing and modifying `JcRawInstList`. _Visitors_ have a standard
interface â€” they can be invoked using an `accept` method on instructions and expressions:
```
val a = jcRawInst.accept(MyInstVisitor())
val b = jcRawExpr.accept(MyExprVisitor())
```

We also provide "functional"-like extensions for applying _visitors_ to `JcRawInstList`:
* `filter(visitor: JcRawInstVisitor<Boolean>): JcRawInstList`
* `filterNot(visitor: JcRawInstVisitor<Boolean>): JcRawInstList`
* `map(visitor: JcRawInstVisitor<JcRawInst>): JcRawInstList`
* `mapNotNull(visitor: JcRawInstVisitor<JcRawInst?>): JcRawInstList`
* `flatMap(visitor: JcRawInstVisitor<Collection<JcRawInst>>): JcRawInstList`
* `apply(visitor: JcRawInstVisitor<Unit>): JcRawInstList`
* `applyAndGet(visitor: T, getter: (T) -> R): R`
* `collect(visitor: JcRawInstVisitor<T>): Collection<T>`

`jcdb-core` has a number of utility _visitors_ for working with the instruction list:
* `ExprMapper(val mapping: Map<JcRawExpr, JcRawExpr>)` &mdash; Traverses an instruction list
and replaces all expression occurrences from `mapping` to the corresponding property.
* `FullExprSetCollector()` &mdash; Collects **all** the expressions that occur in a given object
(instruction list, single instruction or an expression).
* `InstructionFilter(val predicate: (JcRawInst) -> Boolean)` &mdash; Filters the instructions by
a given predicate.

`JcRawInstList` can be converted back to the ASM `MethodNode` using `MethodNodeBuilder.build()`
method. The conversion process is pretty straightforward and does not require any additional
comments.
