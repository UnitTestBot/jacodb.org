# Control flow graph API

A control flow graph of the method is represented as a `JcGraph` object. To create method' `JcGraph`, you can invoke the `graph` function of a three-address instruction list:
```kotlin
fun createGraph(classpath: JcClasspath, method: JcMethod): JcGraph {
    val instructionList = method.instructionList(classpath)
    return instructionList.graph(classpath, method)
}
```

## `JcGraph`

An intermediate representation of `JcGraph` uses the resolved type information (i.e. `JcType`
hierarchy) and classpath information, therefore it requires a classpath instance.
Similar to `JcRawInstList`, `JcGraph` stores a list of method instructions. However, it
also tries to resolve all the execution paths in the method. `JcGraph` operates with
`JcInst` class hierarchy (which is similar to `JcRawInst` in many cases) and provides the following API:
* `entry: JcInst` &mdash; Get the entry point of a method: there can be only one entry point.
* `exits: List<JcInst>` &mdash; Get all the "normal" exit points of a method, i.e. all the return and throw
instructions.
* `throwExits: Map<JcType, List<JcInst>>` &mdash; All the potential exception exit points of a method.
* `ref(inst: JcInst): JcInstRef` &mdash; Get the `JcInstRef` for an instruction. It is a lightweight wrapper that
allows to reference an instruction anytime you need.
* `inst(ref: JcInstRef): JcInst` &mdash; Convert `JcInstRef` into a `JcInst`.
* `previous(inst: JcInst): JcInst` &mdash; Get the previous instruction in the list.
* `next(inst: JcInst): JcInst` &mdash; Get the next instruction in the list.
* `successors(inst: JcInst): Set<JcInst>` &mdash; Get all the successors of an instruction
in a CFG. **Does not include any exception control flow**.
* `predecessors(inst: JcInst): Set<JcInst>` &mdash; Get all the predecessors of an instruction
in a CFG. **Does not include any exception control flow**.
* `throwers(inst: JcInst): Set<JcInst>` &mdash; Get all the instructions that may throw an
exception caught by `inst`. Represents an exception control flow of
a method. Returns an empty set for all instructions except `JcCatchInst`.
* `catchers(inst: JcInst): Set<JcCatchInst>` &mdash; Get all the instructions that may catch an
exception thrown by `inst`. Represents an exception control flow of
a method.
* `exceptionExits(inst: JcInst): Set<JcClassType>` &mdash; Get all the exception types that
an instruction can throw and a method will not catch.
* `blockGraph(): JcBlockGraph` &mdash; Create a basic block representation of a CFG.
* `iterator(): Iterator<JcInst>` &mdash; An iterator over the instructions of a graph.

## `JcBlockGraph`

`JcBlockGraph` is a basic block API for CFG. It operates with `JcBasicBlock` instances — each
basic block just represents an interval of instructions with the following properties:
* Instructions of a basic block are executed consecutively during
the normal execution (i.e. when no exceptions are thrown).
* All the instructions of a basic block have the same exception handlers, i.e. calling
`jcGraph.catchers(inst)` for each instruction of a basic block returns the same result.

`JcBlockGraph` provides the following API:
* `entry: JcBasicBlock` &mdash; Entry of a method. There can be only one entry.
* `exits: List<JcBasicBlock>` &mdash; Exits of a method.
* `instructions(block: JcBasicBlock): List<JcInst>` &mdash; Get the instructions of a basic
block.
* `predecessors(block: JcBasicBlock): Set<JcBasicBlock>` &mdash; Get all the predecessors of a
basic block in a CFG. **Does not include any exception control flow**.
* `successors(block: JcBasicBlock): Set<JcBasicBlock>` &mdash; Get all the successors of a
basic block in a CFG. **Does not include any exception control flow**.
* `throwers(block: JcBasicBlock): Set<JcBasicBlock>` &mdash; Get all the basic blocks that may throw an
exception caught by `block`. Represents an exception control flow of
a method. Returns an empty set for all blocks except the ones that start with `JcCatchInst`.
* `catchers(block: JcBasicBlock): Set<JcBasicBlock>` &mdash; Get all the basic blocks that may catch an
exception thrown by `block`. Represents an exception control flow of a method.

We also provide an API to visualize `JcGraph` and `JcBlockGraph`:
* `JcGraph.view(dotCmd: String, viewerCmd: String, viewCatchConnections: Boolean = false)` &mdash;
Generate an SVG file using DOT (`dotCmd` requires a path to a DOT executable) and view
it using `viewerCmd` program (specify a browser executable). The `viewCatchConnections` flag
defines whether a `throw...catch` connections are to be displayed in the graph.
* `JcBlockGraph.view(dotCmd: String, viewerCmd: String)` &mdash; Similar, but it displays
`JcBlockGraph`.

CFG API operates on `JcInst` instructions. `JcInst` is similar to `JcRawInst` with some
small differences. The main difference is that `JcInst` uses `JcType` instances to represent
types. Another difference is that `JcInst` does not need labels to represent connections
between instructions (as they are stored in `JcGraph`). In all other cases, `JcInst` hierarchy
(including `JcExpr` and `JcValue`) matches largely with `JcRawInst` hierarchy
(including `JcRawExpr` and `JcRawValue`).

One more thing worth noting is that `JcGraph` represents an immutable structure and provides no API for modifying it. That is made on purpose, because modifying CFG
requires a user to be aware of all the connections inside a graph. The user should correctly manage
these connections when changing the CFG. However, one can always create a new copy of
`JcGraph` with all the necessary modifications.

## Examples

You can find an example of CFG modification in the `StringConcatSimplifier` class: it creates new
`JcGraph` in which all the `invokedynamic` string concatenation instructions are
replaced with simple `String.concat` method call.

`ReachingDefinitionsAnalysis` class is an example of using basic block API. It performs
a standard reaching definition analysis for basic blocks using a simple worklist algorithm.

## Visitor API

As for the three-address instruction list, we provide a _visitor_ API for traversing and
modifying `JcGraph`. _Visitors_ have a standard interface — they can be invoked using an
`accept` method on instructions and expressions:
```
val a = jcInst.accept(MyInstVisitor())
val b = jcExpr.accept(MyExprVisitor())
```

We also provide "functional"-like extensions for applying _visitors_ to `JcGraph`:
* `filter(visitor: JcInstVisitor<Boolean>): JcGraph`
* `filterNot(visitor: JcInstVisitor<Boolean>): JcGraph`
* `map(visitor: JcInstVisitor<JcInst>): JcGraph`
* `mapNotNull(visitor: JcInstVisitor<JcInst?>): JcGraph`
* `flatMap(visitor: JcInstVisitor<Collection<JcInst>>): JcGraph`
* `apply(visitor: JcInstVisitor<Unit>): JcGraph`
* `applyAndGet(visitor: T, getter: (T) -> R): R`
* `collect(visitor: JcInstVisitor<T>): Collection<T>`
