# Classpath features

Features are used for building representations based on `JcClasspath` bytecode. One should pass the features
when creating a classpath.

<JavaKotlinCodeBlock javaCode={`
    JcClasspath cp = db.asyncClasspath(files,
        Arrays.asList(new AppendMainMethodToAllClasses())
    ).get();
`} kotlinCode={`
    val cp = db.classpath(files, AppendMainMethodToAllClasses())
`}/>

## `JcClasspathFeature`

This class is a base class for all the features. It has two methods:
- `on(event)` lets one receive events from the other features;
- `event(result, input)` produces events for the other features.

The basic scenario is caching: when an extension gets information on a code structure, this information can be
cached for further usage.

## `JcClasspathExtFeature`

Can be used for mocking or caching:
- `tryFindClass(classpath, name): Optional<JcClassOrInterface>?`
- `tryFindType(classpath, name): Optional<JcType>?`

Returned values should conform to this logic:
- not empty `Optional` for the found class or type;
- empty `Optional` for a class or type that does not exist in the classpath;
- `null` when we do not know if a class or type exists or not.

## `JcClassExtFeature`

Can be used for patching classes with new fields or methods:
- `fieldsOf(clazz)` returns a list of additional fields for a particular class; `null` by default.
- `methodsOf(clazz)` returns a list of additional methods for a particular class. `null` by default.
- `extensionValuesOf(clazz)` returns a map of additional information for a particular class.

`extensionValuesOf` can expose specific information about the classes, for example, from Kotlin or Scala compilers.

## `JcInstExtFeature`

- `transformRawInstList(method: JcMethod, list)` transforms a raw instruction list.
- `transformInstList(method, list)` transforms an instruction list â€” raw instructions remain the same.

# UnknownClass

Can be used to gracefully handle situation that some classes are nor preserved in classpath. i.e.

```java
class Bar {

    int x = 0;

    public void run() {
       System.out.println("Hello world");
    }
}

class Foo extends Bar {

    Bar f = new Bar();

    public void call() {
       System.out.println(f.x);
       run();
    }
}
  ```

Let's assume that we have classpath that contains class `Foo` and doesn't contain `Bar`. Default behavior for
classpath is to fail on trying to access class that doesn't exist. i.e parsing method instructions will fail, reading
class hierarchy will fail, resolving method will fail.

UnknownClasses feature fix this behaviour. All references pointing to nowhere will be resolved as special implementation
of `JcClassOrInterface` instance. Such instance will have **empty** `JcClassOrInterface.declaredFields` and
`JcClassOrInterface.declaredMethods` but all resolutions done through `JcClassOrInterface.lookup` interface will return
mocked instances.
