# Features

Features are used for building view based on real-world `JcClasspath` bytecode. All features should be passed for creating classpath

<JavaKotlinCodeBlock javaCode={`
    JcClasspath cp = db.asyncClasspath(files,
        Arrays.asList(new AppendMainMethodToAllClasses())
    ).get();
`} kotlinCode={`
    val cp = db.classpath(files, AppendMainMethodToAllClasses())
`}/>

## JcClasspathFeature

Based class for all features. There are only two methods:
- `on(event)` feature can implement custom logic receiving events from other features
- `event(result, input)` produces event for other features.

Basic scenario is caching when one extension found something and cache can handle this

## JcClasspathExtFeature

Could be used for mocking or caching
- `tryFindClass(classpath, name): Optional<JcClassOrInterface>?`
- `tryFindType(classpath, name): Optional<JcType>?`

Returned values should conform this logic:

- not empty `Optional` for founded class/type
- empty `Optional` for class/type that is not exist in classpath
- null for case when we do not know

## JcClassExtFeature

Could be used for patching classes with new fields/methods
- `fieldsOf(clazz)` - return list of additional fields for particular class. null by default
- `methodsOf(clazz)`- return list of additional methods for particular class. null by default
- `extensionValuesOf(clazz)`- return map of addiotnal information for particular class.

`extensionValuesOf` could expose specific information about classes. For example some specific information from Kotlin
or Scala compilers

## JcInstExtFeature

- `transformRawInstList(method: JcMethod, list)` - transforming raw instruction list
- `transformInstList(method, list)` - transforming instruction list. Raw instructions will remain the same in this case


## JcMethodExtFeature
