## Introduction

Add this lines to dependencies block in build.gradle.kts:
<CodeBlock language={'kotlin'} codeText={`
    implementation(group = "org.jacodb", name = "jacodb-api", version = jacodbVersion)
    implementation(group = "org.jacodb", name = "jacodb-core", version = jacodbVersion)
    implementation(group = "org.jacodb", name = "jacodb-analysis", version = jacodbVersion)
`} />

Add this lines to dependencies block in pom.xml:

## Contribution guide

General flow for contributing code:

1. Create your own fork of the code.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Implement changes.
5. Test your code:
* Before creating the pull request perform the tests you find necessary for your code changes.
* When implementing something new, it's great to find real users and ask them to try out your feature â€” to prove
the necessity and quality of your suggestion.
6. Create the pull request, and you'll see if the automated tests pass on GitHub. Your reviewer will possibly recommend
you more tests.
7. Please choose [@lehvolk](https://github.com/lehvolk) as a reviewer. He will reassign your PR to someone else from the core team, if necessary.
We do our best in reviewing, but we can hardly specify the exact timeout for it. Be sure that we'll certainly answer your pull request!
