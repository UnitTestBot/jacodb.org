# Testing a type solver

The link to the project repository will be added later, as the project itself has not been announced yet.

## Use case

A multipurpose tool based on symbolic execution has solving type constraints as a part of its core algorithm.
Usually, this task requires SMT solving, which is rather time-consuming. To make the tool
work faster, one should implement a separate `TypeSolver`, involving no SMT solver for this task.

To test the `TypeSolver`, one should feed it with information on classes, their parents, interfaces implemented,
type parameters, and methods, so that the `TypeSolver` could find the proper types.

With JacoDB, you can get this information easily.
