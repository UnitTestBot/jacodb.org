# Implementing approximations

The link to the project repository will be added later, as the project has not been announced yet.

## Use case

Many processes in the real code are optimized: these optimizations help during real execution but inhibit program
analysis. Approximations substitute actual method implementations with the kind of "mocks", which return the
necessary values while providing us with the implementation of the required type.

For example, for a multipurpose tool based on symbolic execution, it is important to approximate some methods:
* Approximations help to simplify method implementations, which are too complex for symbolic execution based analysis.
* Native methods may sometimes have no implementation in the standard library at all. Approximations allow us to
"write the source code" for such methods.
